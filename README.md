I am a condensed matter/AMO theorist who is interested in applications of neural networks, machine learning, and type theoretic mathematics to (mainly quantum) physics. This is a testing ground for ideas and a platform for sharing them, however infequently that turns out to be. In my day-to-day physics research, I am interested in Bose-Einstein condensation and other macroscopic consequences of the fundamentally quantum nature of matter when many particles are present at low energies, and am simultaneously interested in the ways that classical and thermodynamic ideas that are known to describe observed phenomena of macroscopic systems can be best understood from the microscopic perspective. I am intrigued by the problem of reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity, but am far from an expert on GR let alone quantum gravity; in these fields I am more of a dilenttante.
